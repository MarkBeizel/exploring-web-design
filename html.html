            <div class="text">
                <p>     The very first armor was the skin of an animal. The skin was wrapped around the body or simply thrown over the shoulders and hung down from behind, covering the back. This is how the mythical Hercules was dressed or, for example, the Germanic tribes who attacked the Roman Empire before the new era.</p>
                <p>     The reason why in ancient times it was considered more important to protect the back, and not the chest, lies in the specifics of the barbaric tactics of warfare. As ancient sources noted, the barbarians did not consider flight to be shameful, that is, showing the back to the enemy, and if blows aimed at the chest could still be beaten off, then it was more difficult to avoid blows to the back. It is also possible that the barbarians did not keep the formation well and therefore the battle was chaotic - the battle was not reduced to confronting the “line on the line”, which was the Roman system, but to an unordered skirmish of a mass of warriors, and you could get stabbed in the back by another warrior, and not only from the one who was opposite.</p>

It was used at a time when iron armor was no longer worn and when it lost its meaning.</p>
                    <p class="bottom-15">Cloth armor had a different weight - mostly from two to six kilograms, but their cost was relatively low, and therefore they were quite common.</p>

                    <p class="margin-top-5">A further development of the idea of ​​​​protection from skins was armor from several layers of leather.</p>
                    <p>The skin for the manufacture of the shell was taken as hard and thick as possible - preferably from a buffalo or camel, there was also a cow. Then, by boiling in oil, the skin was given additional hardness.</p>
                    <p>Leather armor quickly rotted and fell into disrepair, but had an important property for protection against arrows - viscosity.</p>
                    <p>For all its merits, the leather armor did not at all protect against crushing weapons, in addition, it could be destroyed by several strong blows of a chopping weapon, such as a two-handed sword. Yielding to their later counterparts in protection, leather armor continued to be used as part of the armor or as an underarmor, sometimes leather greaves were worn as additional leg protection in the absence of chain mail greaves.</p>

                <p>    The first lamillar armour was made in ancient Mesopotamia from copper. Then lamillar armour began to be made of bronze, and even later steel. In the latter form, he gained great popularity. </p>
                <p>    The advantages of lamillar armour were obvious: it was easy to make, since only small flat elements had to be forged; in addition, these elements could be made of solid steel - due to their small size, they could not break, but it was almost impossible to cut or pierce hardened steel. In addition, overlapped plates were attached, moreover, in a way that excluded the penetration of the blade under one of them, followed by breaking through the leather base. </p>
                <p>    For all its simplicity, of all the types of armor, lamillar armour turned out to be the most reliable - it made its way only with a bullet, and even then not any. A serious disadvantage of lamillar armour was its heavy weight. For example, solid articulated knightly armor of the 15th century weighed about 25 kilograms, and lamellar armour covering only the chest, back and hips, almost the same.</p>
                <p>    Lamillar armour was used by the Assyrians, Greek hoplites, Roman horsemen, Parthian cataphracts, Carolingian warriors and Russian warriors.</p>

                <p>     Along with lamellar armor, laminar armor (from Latin laminae - layer) began to be used relatively early - from solid transverse strips movably connected to each other. The earliest examples of such body protection date back to the Mycenaean era.</p>
                <p>     The most famous examples of laminar armor are the Roman lorica segmentata and some of the later varieties of Japanese samurai armor. In addition to the segmentata lorica, full laminar protection of the limbs was also known in ancient Rome, but it was practically not used in the army, mainly used by gladiators, who usually protected only one arm (in some cases also one leg) with an unprotected body. A similar type of armor was also used in the Mongolian army.</p>

                <p>     An alternative to scale armours was the most popular armor in Europe of the Middle Ages - chain mail, which, starting from the 10th century, chain mail with short sleeves.</p>
                <p>     According to the leading European historians of weapons (P. Connolly, J. Varry, E. Oakeshott and others), for the first time this type of body protection appeared in antiquity among the Celts, and was borrowed from them by the Romans relatively early. By the beginning of the 12th century, such a ringed shirt, called a hauberka, already had long sleeves and almost completely covered the body, additionally reinforced with a chain mail hood and chain mail stockings.</p>
                <p>     Such armor completely protected the body, weighed relatively little (about 8 kg, full with stockings up to 40 (according to Oakeshott) kg) and did not greatly hinder movement. Chain mail was made by drawing from iron wire, which was then cut into rings, partially riveted, and later welded. Wealthy warriors could have weaves made from copper rings.</p>

                <p>    In Europe, this type of armor was called a brigantine. Initially, the plates were attached to the kotta, later they began to be attached simply to the fabric base. The brigantine significantly increased protection, adding another 5-8 kg to his weight.</p>
                <p>    Plate armor, which appeared in the 10th century, could be lamellar, later scaly. They were worn on a leather or quilted jacket, sometimes on chain mail. The plates could be fastened together in different ways, later they were attached to a leather or cloth base. So they were more flexible and mobile. A characteristic appearance of fish scales was scaly armor, the plates of which had a rounded lower edge.</p>
                <p>    In the manufacture of brigantine, chain mail and scales, only one type of metal was used: iron in the first two cases and steel in the third.</p>

                <p>     Plate armor was the pinnacle of the blacksmith industry of the Middle Ages. Their weight varied from one to three tens of kilograms, the full set protected almost the entire body of the owner, only the articulations of the plates, armpits and eye slits in a deaf helmet remained vulnerable.</p>
                <p>     For the same reasons, their cost was very high and a high-quality plate set could cost, without exaggeration, as much as a whole village. Plate armor was worn primarily by knights of the great Middle Ages, since the rest of the aristocracy had no desire to take part in battles directly, and commoners did not have sufficient financial resources to purchase such armor. If the weapon in those days had an acceptable price for the average city dweller, who could buy it for self-defense or for hire, then the appearance of plate armor left no doubt that their wearer would soon use his weapon against the same owners.</p>
                <p>     Most often, such armor was made by private forges to order, engraving and decoration of the finished product was not uncommon.</p>
